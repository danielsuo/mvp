## Ideas that improve file size
- SVG defs to reuse definition of icons
- Minify and optimize svg via svgo
- Turn elements into a single large path
- Gzip SVGs

## Ideas that improve performance
- https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2014/11/6-tips-optimising-svg-files/
- Render SVG icons with icon fonts. Example [here](http://frozeman.de/blog/2013/08/why-is-svg-so-slow/).
  - Cross-browser icon fonts [here](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/bulletproof_icon_fonts.html)
  - Pros and cons [here](http://cubicleninjas.com/icon-fonts-explained-benefits-pitfalls/)
  - Image sprites vs icon fonts [here](http://www.jontetzlaff.com/blog/2013/04/29/image-sprites-vs-web-icon-fonts/)
- Reduce number of redraws
- Reusing symbols? Example [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8604999/does-reusing-symbols-improve-svg-performance)
- Use CSS transforms on HTML element holding SVG, not on SVG directly
- Use rounded coordinates. Example [here](https://www.mapbox.com/osmdev/2012/11/20/getting-serious-about-svg/)
- Use rasterized images wherever possible
- http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2014/tips-for-optimising-svg-delivery-for-the-web/
- Don't parse then draw svg; draw directly when possible

## Ideas that improve both performance and file size
- Use CSS to style SVG elements, rather than per-element styling
- Cut up SVG layers into cells and only load what is needed
- Remove unnecessary layers and paths
- Use SVG to represent blocks and floor plan only
- [âˆš] Draw background as image / don't use SVG.js to render -> use browser to render
- Store object locations rather than all data for how an object looks (lends well to using SVG refs)
- Canvas?
